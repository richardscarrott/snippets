# Snippets

The Snippets chrome extension provides easy access to JavaScript snippets, allowing you to manage and maintain your snippets using GitHub.

Currently there are two views for your snippets:

### 1) Context Menu
The context menu provides easy access and discovery of snippets by right clicking anywhere in the page. Clicking on a snippet will execute it in the current tab.

### 2) Omnibox
The omnibox is the fastest way to find and execute a snippet allowing you to fuzzy search all available snippets. To activate the Snippets omnibox, focus on the address bar and type '`s`' then `tab` or `space`. Once activated you can begin to fuzzy search.

> :bulb: You can use `âŒ˜+l` to jump straight to the address bar.
